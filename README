How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
  One way that i write programs that are easy to maintain is simplistic in line comments to help identify portions of the code as well as putting spaces between chunks of code to help overall make it easier to read and adjust as i add or remove things, such as from project one to project two a portion of the code worked for the first but create errors in the second so being able to easily find and identify that was incredibly helpful
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
  One main approach i had esspecily with these projects was to find similar ideas to help get an understanding of how an application like this should work as i was very unfamiliar with a project like this and was incredibly lost at many points in the [rocess
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
  Computer scientists help to create, optimize or solve issues that are had to help allow for other things to work as intended or work more efficiently to allow for an overall better experience for whatever a user is looking for
